show-paragraph: I've made this blog to do 2 things. Share knowledge in an easy and understandable manner, and do it faster than your coffee read in the office or a toilet break when reading on your phone. Really, that's what everyone does. Right? That being said, each post will focus on 1 problem and 1 solution. As this is just a beginning, the format might change with time. Still with me? Let's go.

## Who is writing this blog?

I'm a Lead UI/UX designer based in Barcelona, currently currently working for [Quipu](https://getquipu.com), an amazing cloud invoicing & accounting software. I recently moved here from London and, frankly, never looked back! My story with blockchain, especially Ethereum, started by doing a quick mockup for a decentralised smart contract app for our company for the Mobile World Congress held every year here in Barcelona. It came later, to my surprise, that Quipu has actually won the contest there!

Completely unaware of what that "blockchain thingy" was. Until some weeks later a friend mentioned made me aware of it again. I fell in love. It was like a happy ending in a Hollywood movie, except that happy ever after thing, still goes on.

## What can I expect to learn here?

Among basic things like how to create a wallet, how to convert one ERC token to another (e.g. ETH to GNT) using services like [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io) etc...

You will also see my take at improving usability and accessibility through UX design (e.g. why current wallets are kind of a hassle and how can we make them easier to use) and spreading awareness.

## What's next?

This post is one of it's kind. This is in fact one of the very few posts I expect to not directly focus on a particular problem, instead being more general as one would expect from a "Hello World" post.
So stay tuned, and prepare for some real action!

One of the expected formats of upcoming posts will be a short "1 problem 1 solution" series of posts where I will show you step by step how to do basic things like Creating a Wallet, Creating a Cold Wallet (and wth is cold wallet), doing transfers the right way and so on.

Expect those posts to be accompanied by a youtube video, that will probably be more engaging and hands on.

## Summary

I'm really excited to be here and share my thoughts with you all. In fact I've always wanted to write a blog, but never truly found a topic exciting to blog about. See you in few days!
